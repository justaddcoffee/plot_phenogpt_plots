My most likely diagnosis: Acute myocarditis secondary to a possible infection  Differential diagnoses, ranked by probability:  1. Acute myocarditis: The symptoms like fever, chest pain, abnormal EKG, myalgia, and syncope could point towards an inflammation of heart muscles, possibly due to a viral infection (gastroenteritis causing diarrhea, vomiting, poor appetite, and nausea can be a trigger). 2. Infectious mononucleosis: Could present with fever, chest pain, syncope, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and poor appetite. 3. Gastroenteritis: Would primarily explain the gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, poor appetite), as well as a general malaise like fever, myalgia. 4. Kawasaki disease: Common in children and teenagers. It can present with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, myalgia, and chest pain due to myocarditis and associated EKG changes. 5. Acute pericarditis: Fever, chest pain, and EKG changes could be due to inflammation of the pericardium around the heart. 6. Neoplastic conditions: The nevus could be a sign of a paraneoplastic syndrome, causing a variety of the listed symptoms, though this is less likely without more specific signs of malignancy. 7. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: Would primarily account for gastrointestinal symptoms but eosinophilia can cause myocardial involvement as well. Quite rare though. 8. Addison’s disease: It can cause nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, myalgia, syncope, and hyperpigmentation (seen as nevus). Very rare with no obvious adrenal insufficiency symptoms, hence it's lower in my list. 9. Lyme disease: Transmission is rare in some areas, but would account for many of the nonspecific symptoms, including possible cardiac involvement (Lyme carditis). 10. Systemic lupus erythematosus: This autoimmune disease can cause a wide range of symptoms, including gastrointestinal and cardiac symptoms.  We would need additional information and test results for a more accurate diagnosis, but these are the differentials based on the given symptoms.		-1		5	3	2	6
