PMID_33503346-txt_without_discussion.txt	Systemic primary amyloidosis.	The most likely diagnosis based on this information is Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA).  Differential Diagnosis:  1. Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) or Temporal arteritis: This patient's age, jaw claudication, anemia, raised liver enzymes, weight loss, and history of temporal headache, along with the visual symptoms align with this diagnosis. GCA often presents with transient visual loss, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated inflammatory markers.  2. Orbital mass: Given the palpable orbital mass and ptosis, an orbital mass or tumor could be causing pressure symptoms leading to visual changes.  3. Autoimmune disease: The bilateral hip discomfort and joint issues in a hand could suggest an autoimmune process like rheumatoid arthritis. The negative antinuclear antibodies don't completely rule out this possibility.  4. Neurological disorder: Transient vision loss could originate from a neuro-ophthalmologic concern such as multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis, although his other symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss and palpable mass lean more towards a systemic condition.  5. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR): some of the symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, hip pain can be seen in PMR, but the ocular symptoms, jaw pain, and anemia are more suggestive of GCA than PMR, given the lack of prominent muscle pain and stiffness.   6. Infectious diseases: Considering the patient's history of international travel, it's essential to consider global health conditions, such as tuberculosis or parasitic infections that could cause systemic symptoms. However, these are less likely than GCA or a localized orbital mass.  7. Lymphoma: this condition can cause B symptoms (like fatigue and weight loss) and a mass. However, the sudden vision loss is less typical for lymphoma.   8. Thyroid eye disease: Given the ptosis and orbital mass, thyroid eye disease could be a consideration. Although the patient's thyroid function test results were normal and there was no proptosis (typical finding in thyroid eye disease).	0	-1		0	0		0

Colonic Mucosal Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) - This patient has had a recent transplant. GVHD could be a potential issue, and the colonic mucosal variant can present as diarrhea.  2. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura - The presence of thrombocytopenia and decreased hemoglobin suggestive of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia leads to suspect this, but the absence of schistocytes weakens that probability.  3. Acute Hemorrhagic Colitis - The stool examination did not identify any pathogens but this does not rule out the diagnosis.  4. Drug-induced injury or hypersensitivity - The change in her regimen to everolimus, a drug known to cause thrombocytopenia, might be relevant.  5. CMV colitis - Considering her transplanted status, CMV infection which is known to cause colitis and thrombocytopenia could be a possible cause. But the absence of fever and initial serology results reduce this possibility.  6. Hemorrhoids - Despite the severity of the woman's other symptoms, the continued rectal bleeding and discomfort could potentially be attributed to hemorrhoids.  7. Infectious Colitis - Although Clostridioides difficile was negative, other infectious etiologies such as Shigella or enteroinvasive E. coli could be considered.  8. Ischemic colitis - She has a history of hypertension. Chronic ischemia can cause inflammation and bleeding in the colon, but the severity of her thrombocytopenia suggests a more systemic issue.  9. Invasive colorectal carcinoma - Less likely given the acute onset and her relatively young age, but malignancy can sometimes manifest as bleeding.	3	2		3	3		0

Sarcoidosis with organ (liver, lung, and spleen) involvement leading to hepatosplenomegaly and lung disease.  Differential Diagnosis (ranked): 1. Sarcoidosis exacerbation: Considering the patient's history and biopsy results, her symptoms could be indicative of a sarcoidosis flare-up, particularly if the disease affects several organs.  2. Drug-induced liver injury: The hepatosplenomegaly and abnormal liver function tests could be due to methotrexate or prednisone therapy. 3. Autoimmune hepatitis: This possibility would have to be considered since autoimmune diseases occasionally co-exist, though the negative autoantibodies decrease its likelihood. 4. Tuberculosis: Even though the interferon-γ test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative, it is essential to consider this due to family exposure. 5. Chronic granulomatous disease: This is a rare condition but would present with granulomas in multiple tissues/organs. 6. Lymphoma: Often presents with general ill-health, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly. It can mimic sarcoidosis in biopsy. 7.

Opioid Overdose / Opioid Toxicity - The patient was administered several opioid pain relievers post-procedure, and her symptoms (decreased responsiveness, increased respiratory effort, low oxygen saturation) align with signs of opioid overdose. 2. Anesthetic Induced Neurotoxicity - The patient was given several anesthetic agents during the procedure. Some of these can potentially lead to neurotoxicity, which could cause her altered mental status and other neurological symptoms. 3. Postoperative Pulmonary Embolism - This condition is a common complication after any type of surgery and can cause the respiratory problems and altered mental status seen in the patient. 4. Allergic Reaction / Anaphylaxis to Medications - An allergic reaction to the mix of medications administered during and after the procedure could cause some of the symptoms. However, other symptoms related to anaphylaxis, such as rash or swelling, were not mentioned in the case.  5. Scopolamine Withdrawal Syndrome - The removal of the scopolamine patch could have caused withdrawal syndrome, explaining the symptoms. 6. Lidocaine toxicity - The local anesthetic used during the patient's surgery could potentially cause neurologic and cardiovascular issues in case of overdose or systemic absorption. Symptoms of lidocaine toxicity could include CNS depression (explained by the lethargy of the patient) and cardiovascular instability which are not clearly displayed in the case.  However, the specifics of the presenting symptoms and the signs (respiratory distress and altered mental status following an operative procedure involving the administration of multiple narcotic medications) make option 1 the most likely.	3	3		3	3		0

Differential Diagnoses:  1. Cogan's syndrome: Given the prominent symptoms of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, eye inflammation, and potential systemic symptoms such as fatigue and body aches.  2. Wegener’s granulomatosis (also known as granulomatosis with polyangiitis): This could present with similar symptoms such as hearing loss and eye involvement, but usually also features respiratory or kidney issues which are not apparent in this case.  3. Temporal arteritis (Giant cell arteritis): This could be a possibility due to the patient's age, temporal headache, and elevated sedimentation rate, but the bilateral hearing loss and eye involvement is not as typically associated with this condition.    4. Neurosyphilis: This can display with a variety of neurological symptoms, including hearing loss, but patient does not have a history of risky sexual behavior and other typical manifestations like cognitive changes or movement disorders are not reported.   5. Lyme disease: In certain cases, could present with similar ENT features, especially in New England, however the characteristic skin rash is missing and multiple system involvement is not reported.   6. Autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED): This could explain the hearing loss and tinnitus, but typically doesn't present with eye inflammation.  7. Viral labyrinthitis or vestibular neuronitis: These can cause vestibular symptoms and hearing loss, but usually happen acutely with severe vertigo and nausea, and would not explain the eye inflammation.   8. Sarcoidosis: Could cause similar ENT symptoms, but typically there are lung findings and the patient's imaging has been clear thus far.  9. Vasculitis (non-Wegener's): Could present with similar systemic symptoms and possibly affect hearing and eyesight, but usually presents with more specific signs or symptoms relative to the affected vascular beds.  10. Meningioma or other neurologic tumors: Neurologic tumors or lesions could interfere with hearing and balance, but the lack of findings on neuroimaging makes this less likely.	5	4		5	5		0

PMID_36300978-txt_without_discussion.txt	Sarcoidosis.	Most Likely Diagnosis: Pediatric granulomatous uveitis  Differential Diagnoses: 1. Pediatric granulomatous uveitis due to sarcoidosis: The case presented suggests bilateral inflammation of the anterior segment of the eye (uveitis) with characteristic signs of granulomatous inflammation (keratic precipitates, iris nodules), and hilar fullness on chest radiography which may suggest hilar lymphadenopathy, a common feature of sarcoidosis. 2. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) associated uveitis: Given the patient's age and lack of systemic symptoms, Uveitis may be associated with JIA. 3. Pediatric granulomatous uveitis due to tuberculosis: Even though the interferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was indeterminate, we cannot completely rule out tubercular etiology. 4. Uveitis associated with systemic autoimmune diseases: Eye involvement can occur in systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases. 5. Infectious uveitis: As the causative agents, we should consider viruses (Herpes simplex, CMV) as well as bacteria (including Bartonella, Lyme disease, and Syphilis), yet the patient has negative blood tests for Lyme disease and Syphilis and no systemic signs of infection. 6. Uveitis of Idiopathic origin. 7. Paediatric granulomatous uveitis due to Behcet’s disease: However, this is less likely due to the absence of oral/genital ulceration.	4	1		4	4		0
