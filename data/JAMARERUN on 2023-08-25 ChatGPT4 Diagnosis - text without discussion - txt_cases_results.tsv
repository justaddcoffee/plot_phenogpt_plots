Deep Venous Thrombosis - Given the patient's history of DVT and current symptoms. 6. Acute Limb Ischemia - Would explain the sudden onset of pain and ecchymosis, but the presence of normal pulse and capillary refill suggests otherwise. 7. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome - Rare, but could present with similar symptoms. 8. Spontaneous Rupture of Tendon or Muscle - These could lead to ecchymosis and pain, but usually there's an apparent defect and notable loss of function. 9.

PMID_34161710-case-prior-to-discussion.txt	Delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy.	Most Likely Diagnosis: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma causing a paraneoplastic syndrome.  Differential Diagnosis, from most to least likely:  1. Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis secondary to metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The patient's history of cancer, new onset behavioral changes, and cognitive problems could suggest a disease process involving the brain.   2. Recurrence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Given the patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to his cervical lymph nodes, one has to consider recurrence or lingering effects of the cancer.   3. Medication side effects or withdrawal. The patient was on multiple medications for pain control, some of which could affect cognition if stopped abruptly.   4. Behavioral or psychiatric disorder possibly exacerbated by recent illness and/or medication withdrawal. The patient has recently experienced several traumatic events (cancer, surgeries, decrease in medications), which could lead to an acute psychiatric episode.    5. Neurodegenerative disease process, such as early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The CT scan showed nonspecific changes, and the patient's symptoms could also suggest a neurodegenerative process.    6. Infection or systemic inflammatory response syndrome resulting in a delirium state. Given recent hospital admissions and septic shock, it could be possible that he has an undetected infection.    7. Post-anoxic brain injury as a result of the accidental overdose. The patient had a significant episode of hypoxia which could have resulted in some level of anoxic brain injury.     8. Transient global amnesia, a temporary loss of memory. His symptoms and history of cancer could fit with this diagnosis, but it is less likely given the duration of symptoms.    9. Non-convulsive status epilepticus, which could account for the cognitive and behavioral changes.	3	7		3	3		0

Cerebrovascular disease causing cognitive impairment  Given the patient's age, normocytic anemia, elevated bilirubin levels, and gastrointestinal symptoms, malignancies including colorectal cancer and gastric lymphoma must be considered even though endoscopy findings were reportedly normal. Peptic ulcer disease and chronic pancreatitis are also possibilities that could explain the patient's epigastric pain, anorexia, and weight loss. Depression also needs to be considered, particularly in light of the patient's suicidal ideation and memory impairment. Cognitive impairments could be due to early stages of dementia, cerebrovascular disease or depression. In relation to the normocytic anemia and elevated bilirubin level, this could point towards liver disease or could be a manifestation of chronic disease. Further investigational tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis.	0	-1		0	0		0

Susac Syndrome: This condition involves triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusion and hearing loss. However, no neurological symptoms or retinal artery occlusions are mentioned, making this diagnosis less likely.  3. granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegner's): This could explain the symptoms of ear and eye disease, as well as the headaches, but lacks the typical upper respiratory tract or renal involvement.  4. systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Given the presence of fatigue, body aches, and eye problems, SLE could be a possibility, but the patient doesn’t have the other common systemic symptoms.  5. Sjögren’s Syndrome: Can present with ear problems and eye issues, but typical dry mouth and dry eye symptoms are not reported.  6. Behçet’s Disease: This is characterized by systemic inflammation, including the potential for audiovisual impairment. However, the patient presents no genital or oral ulcers, a key symptom of Behçet’s.  7. Syphilis: Syphilis can have numerous presentations, including ocular and audiological symptoms, but the patient has only had one sexual partner for many years, which lowers the likelihood.  8. Tuberculosis: This patient has a history of weight loss and fatigue which could be symptoms of TB. However, he doesn't have respiratory symptoms, making it unlikely.   9. HIV/AIDS: Although this can present variably and affect many systems, the patient’s lifestyle, including his monogamous relationship and absence of drug use, makes this less probable.    10.

Myocarditis: Elevated creatine kinase, troponin T, and ESR, met with symptoms like chest pain, fever, nausea, and syncope point to inflammation of the heart muscle. 2. Acute Coronary Syndrome: Elevated creatine kinase and troponin T with the presentation of chest pain suggest myocardial infarction. However, it is less likely given the patient's age. 3. Albuterol-induced Hypokalemia: Potassium levels are within the normal range, but albuterol usage could cause hypokalemia leading to cardiac abnormalities. 4. Endocarditis: Febrile illness followed by cardiac manifestation could indicate bacterial endocarditis. However, the lack of murmur and blood culture report negate the likelihood. 5. Pericarditis: Symptoms of chest pain increasing with deep breaths and lying flat could suggest inflammation of the pericardium. However, the ECG and echocardiography results should ultimately confirm or rule this out. 6. Arrhythmia: Albuterol could cause arrhythmias that could lead to fainting, but the low blood glucose level could also be a contributing factor for syncope. 7. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy: It is possible, given the borderline enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest radiography, but more data from echocardiography is required. It is less likely given that such dilated cardiomyopathies at this age are usually familial, and no such history is indicated. 8. Acute Rheumatic Fever: Acute rheumatic fever could cause myocarditis, however, the absence of arthritis and other Jones criteria make it unlikely. 9. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Given his young age, syncope, and elevated cardiac markers, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a possibility, yet echocardiography would provide more definitive confirmation. 10. Pulmonary Embolism: Although chest pain and shortness of breath are symptoms common in PE, there are numerous other symptoms and examination findings that are not present in this case thus making PE less likely.	3	8		3	3		0
