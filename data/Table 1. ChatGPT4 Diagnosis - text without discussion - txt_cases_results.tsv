PMID_33913642-case.txt	Nodular follicular thyroid neoplasm with a somatic NRAS mutation.	Most Likely Diagnosis: Cervical neuroblastoma   Differential Diagnoses, Ranked by Probability: 1. Cervical neuroblastoma: This tumor arises from the sympathetic chain and often presents as a neck mass in neonates. The presence of displacement of the trachea without compression, along with the markedly hypervascular ultrasound image supports this diagnosis. 2. Cervical teratoma: These are often large, vascular neck masses. The baby's increased alpha-fetoprotein levels may point to this diagnosis; however, these tumors are usually heterogeneous (containing various tissue types) and the mass in this case appears homogenous on ultrasound. 3. Cervical lymphangioma: These benign, lymphatic malformations can present as a neck mass in newborns. However, they are typically multicystic; this mass appears solid in imaging. 4. Other neck masses such as a branchial cleft cyst or thyroid goiter: While both of these can present as neck masses in newborns, neither is consistent with the imaging findings and other clinical characteristics of this case. 5. Less likely differential diagnoses in a newborn can include a thymic cyst, thyroid adenoma, or parathyroid adenoma, but these all seem less likely given the clinical and radiologic findings presented here.   Diagnostic tests to be performed: From the case, it appears a diagnostic procedure is performed, likely a biopsy of the mass. The definitive diagnosis of these conditions is often made by histological examination of the mass tissue. Additional ancillary tests, such as immunohistochemistry or cytogenetic studies, can further support the diagnosis.	2	5		2	2	2	0

Cicatricial pemphigoid: This could cause mouth ulcers, though other typical features are absent. 8. Lymphoma: The presence of prominent lymph nodes in the CT scan raises a possible malignancy like lymphoma which can manifest with systemic symptoms like weight loss. 9. Squamous cell carcinoma: This could present with oral ulcers and weight loss, but biopsy results do not support this diagnosis. 10. Tuberculosis: This can sometimes present with ulcers and weight loss, and endemic areas were visited by the patient. However, lung involvement is not typical, and no other signs of infection are present. 11. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient has a medical history of GERD, which could cause weight loss due to difficulty swallowing, but it would not explain the oral ulcers.	0	-1		0	0	0	0
PMID_34758256-case.txt	Seizure from neurocysticercosis.	Most likely diagnosis: Neurocysticercosis.  Differential Diagnosis (ranked by probability):  1. Neurocysticercosis: Given the patient's immigration history from rural Guatemala, where this parasitic infection is endemic, this could be the cause of his reported seizures and altered mental status.  2. Encephalitis: This could be due to a viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection and could cause seizures and altered mental status.  3. Meningitis: This can cause an altered level of consciousness and seizures, but the absence of fever and neck stiffness makes it less likely in this case.  4. Brain tumor: Could cause seizures and an altered mental status, but this is less likely given the patient's relatively young age and the absence of other neurological symptoms.  5. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: This could present with seizures and an altered mental state. However, the lack of a headache or vomiting makes it less likely.  6. Epileptic seizures: Given the history of a first tonic-clonic seizure, primary epilepsy may be a possibility. However, given the dramatic presentation and lack of personal or family history of epilepsy, this would be a less likely diagnosis.  7. Drug or Alcohol Withdrawal: Despite the patient reporting limited alcohol and no illicit drug use, withdrawal could potentially lead to seizures and altered mental status.  8. Cerebral Vasculitis: This is a rare condition but could cause seizures and altered mental status due to inflammation and damage to brain tissue.  9. Metabolic disturbances: Hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia or any significant electrolyte imbalance could lead to neurological signs. However, given the normal blood glucose level, this seems unlikely.  10. Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES): These are seizure-like episodes that are psychological, not neurological, in nature. The episodes tend to be less predictable than epileptic seizures and may resemble a variety of neurological disorders.	5	1		5	5	5	0

Most Likely Diagnosis:  Septicemia due to Gram-negative bacteria, likely Pseudomonas aeruginosa or E. coli, contracted from handling the deer hide in the process of taxidermy.   Differential Diagnosis (from most to least likely): 1. Infectious cellulitis - likely bacterial, related to exposure from deer hide or ticks. 2.

Pyogenic joint infection or septic arthritis - possible pathogen exposure from deer hide. 7. Tick-born illnesses (other than Lyme disease) - ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis due to tick removal from deer hide. 8.

Anthrax (cutaneous) - possible exposure from handling of deer hide. 10. Rat-bite fever - exposure possible from handling of raw hide. 11.

PMID_35045230-case.txt	VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome.	Most Likely Diagnosis: Relapsing polychondritis with progression to systemic vasculitis  Robust Differential Diagnosis: 1. Relapsing Polychondritis - The patient initially presented with cartilage inflammation that affects the ears, nose, joints, and respiratory tract, which is classic for relapsing polychondritis. 2. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus – It might be possible given the systemic nature of the symptoms, but the patient lacks some common findings such as malar rash, photosensitivity, and positive ANA. 3. Antisynthetase syndrome - This could present with myalgia, but usually involves dysphagia and has a particular rash (mechanic’s hands), none of which the patient has. 4. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis - This could be probable due to the systemic symptoms. However, the patient’s c-ANCA and p-ANCA tests were negative, which would argue against this diagnosis. 5. Polymyalgia rheumatica - The initial diagnosis based on muscle pain and stiffness particularly in the morning in a person over 50 might fit, but the disease progression is not typical of Polymyalgia rheumatica. 6. Rheumatoid Arthritis - Predominantly a joint disease, the systemic effects of Rheumatoid Arthritis could potentially align with some of the symptoms. But the lack of joint degradation and negative factor make it less likely. 7. Giant cell arteritis - This could at first present similarly to polymyalgia rheumatica, the lack of headache, jaw claudication or vision changes makes this diagnosis less likely. 8. Behçet’s disease - Could explain the mucosal ulceration (scleritis), venous thrombosis, and positive pathergy test. However, the patient lacks oral and genital ulcers typically seen in Behçet’s disease. 	0	-1		0	0	0	0

Most Likely Diagnosis: Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by a metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, with concurrent Histoplasmosis infection.  Differential Diagnoses:  1. Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by a metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor: Supported by elevated cortisol & ACTH levels, presence of pancreatic exophytic mass, multiple metastases, histopathological findings in pituitary biopsy inconsistent with corticotroph adenoma, and no history of tuberculosis skin test positivity, differential effects on psychological health with etomidate, lorazepam interventions, and subsequent positive effects after bilateral adrenalectomy and cortisol management.  2. Cushing's disease secondary to a recurrent pituitary corticotroph adenoma: Despite failing two operations and a pathology report inconsistent with this diagnosis, the history of two pituitary surgeries, residual pituitary lesion and ongoing high cortisol & ACTH levels could suggest persistent pituitary origin.  3. Adrenal Cushing's syndrome: Presence of adrenal gland thickening could suggest an adrenal source of excess cortisol, although the ACTH levels would not typically be high in this scenario.  4. Adrenal Carcinoma: The adrenal thickening and elevated cortisol levels could also suggest this diagnosis, however, the ACTH levels are inappropriately high for this setting.  5. Chronic histoplasmosis infection: Supported by the positive urine test for histoplasma antigen, imaging findings in the right upper lung lobe and presence of immunosuppressive states (Cushing's Syndrome), but negative BAL fluid culture.  6. Secondary bacterial pneumonia: Demonstrated by growth of Staphylococcus aureus in BAL fluid and imaging findings, but other concurrent infections may be more likely.  7.

Further testing would help to rule out or confirm these differential diagnoses.	5	1		5	5	5	0
